Description: PyGTK is a set of bindings for the GTK+ widget set. It provides an object
        oriented interface that is slightly higher level than the C one. It
        automatically does all the type casting and reference counting that you
        would have to do normally with the C API. You can find out more on the
        official homepage, http://www.pygtk.org/
